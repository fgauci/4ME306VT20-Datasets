Personally I prefer using the PC to update cards, however I do understand its value for standups.","Maybe have the option to add more comments after adding the first one, without having to open the navbar menu.","Having the menu in the homepage might be a bit redundant, as the options are available as buttons on the home screen.",

Being able to upload and work in digital version of the physical board gives us more flexibility.","Adding further codes on cards for more information, for example related project plans, since these are fixed and decided prior to starting sprints",N/A,

Using an application such as this, would enable us to attain and maintain an uncluttered virtual working environment that is ideal for keeping up with our own development progress and ultimately sustain consistent productivity throughout.","There aren’t many changes I would consider for the application, except for adding icons next to features for quick identification - constructing implicit dialogue between the application and its users that could be  very useful after multiple uses.","A very interesting concept to introduce within the company, especially given our relative dependence on the efficient scrum methodologies throughout our workflow.",

With the looks of it, this app would combine processes and reduce the time taken for updates.","Make it more visually clear that the QR code is scanning, provide links to Trello directly from the app (e.g. after the board is uploaded) and have buttons to add more comments after adding the first comment",N/A,
User 6,24,Software Developer,CRM,5,4,4,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,"Given how easy it is to navigate and use, I feel that iMovo can benefit from utilising this application in order to help facilitate Scrum meetings and update any necessary information easily and in a straight-forward manner. This application would help us greatly with maintaining an organised working environment thus aiding productivity levels.","Some minor visual changes, such as icons, to make the interface a little bit more appealing and easier to read would be appreciated, however, the system is functional and intuitive to use as it is. The system, however, offers all the desired functionality without any unnecessary bells and whistles which other applications offer.",N/A,

The key benefit, especially with COVID-19, is that by having an always up to date digital copy people working remotely can better keep track of progress.","Functionally it could be a very powerful tool to use the app to highlight key differences in the board between Trello and the physical board, especially for people working remotely. Perhaps at the start of a stand up a list of ‘changes’ can be reviewed where cards on Trello are no longer where they are on the board, and used to update the physical board.","Very interesting concept that I’d really like to see and experience in an actual stand up. Would be even cooler if sticky notes had QR codes printed or embedded within them so they’re not in your face, a la the digital Moleskin notebooks. ",
User 8,29,Business Analyst,CX,4,4,3,4,4,4,5,4,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,"Yes, especially given the fact that we use both types of boards and have to spend a lot of time in updating each one",I would suggest showing a box or indicator in the window/screen when a user is scanning a QR code for a card. This will help the user in understanding better the scanning process.,"The application quite straightforward and the idea is quite useful, not just for us, but for companies who also work with physical boards! Well done :)!",

User 10,57,Project Manager,Data Science,5,4,5,5,3,4,4,3,4,5,5,5,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,3,3,5,5,4,"Definitely, mianly as it is an interesting time-saving technique post decision meetings.",Would it be possible to see comments back on Trello after these have been added?,What a great and innovative idea. The biggest frustration with meetings is that people walk away and not document anything discussed.,

Would be great if the app could support more custom fields that are usually found on Trello cards. An external camera / service attached at the top of a “task room” could actually automate the process of updating the status of tasks once moved, acting as the human who takes the photo.",No.,
